Hello everyone! I'm sharing a tibiacom Canary Black layout for anyone who might be interested.

Features:
Compiled Images: Includes various compiled images sourced from other existing layouts.

Custom Coloring: Features several elements I personally colored for a unique look.

Custom Boxes: Comes with some custom-designed boxes that you are free to remove at any time.

Included Files
To make customization easy, the following files are included:

Logo: The main layout logo.

Logo PSD: The Photoshop Document file for the logo, allowing you to edit it to your liking.

Font: The specific font used in the layout.

Customization Tip: Disable Logo Animation
If you prefer a static logo, you can easily disable the 'floatAnimation' effect.

Open the basic.css file.

Look for the section that controls the logo's animation.

Comment out or remove the relevant code block to disable the floatAnimation effect.

Enjoy the layout!
